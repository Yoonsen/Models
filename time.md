What was heideggers basic thesis about space and time
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
Heidegger's basic thesis about space and time, primarily discussed in Being and Time (Sein und Zeit), revolves around the concept of Dasein (human existence) and how it experiences space and time.

Time: Heidegger argues that time is not a mere sequence of moments but is fundamentally tied to the existence of Dasein. He introduces the concept of "temporality" (Zeitlichkeit), where the past, present, and future are interwoven in how we understand and project our being in the world. Time is thus existential rather than just a measurable entity.

Space: Heidegger's view on space is that it is not an abstract, geometric concept but is instead "lived space" or "world-space" — spaces in which Dasein is meaningfully engaged. Space is understood through our activities, purposes, and the relationships we establish with things around us.

For Heidegger, both space and time are deeply connected to human existence, where time is the horizon for understanding being, and space is experienced in terms of how we navigate and interact within our world.






Du sa:
Yes, we could think that time is a kind of human (or animal) construct, same with space, in the sense that what is counted as fast and slow, big and small is done relative to our conception. Did heidegger touch on that (or others)?
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
Yes, Heidegger does touch on these ideas, though perhaps not in the explicit terms of space and time as mere "constructs." Heidegger sees both time and space as fundamentally related to human existence (Dasein) and how we understand and interpret our world.

Time as a Human Construct
Heidegger's concept of temporality emphasizes that time is not just an external, objective sequence of moments but is deeply tied to how we exist and perceive our being. In Being and Time, he argues that the understanding of time as a linear series of "nows" (what he calls "vulgar time") is a secondary, derived understanding that comes from a more fundamental experience of time — the ekstases of the past, present, and future. These are not "in" time but are how we experience time in relation to our existence, our "being-toward-death," our projections, and our thrownness into the world. Time, in this sense, is indeed a kind of construct that arises from our existential situation.

Space as a Human Construct
For space, Heidegger similarly argues that our understanding of it is not primarily geometric or objective but rather tied to our practical engagements in the world. What counts as "near" or "far," "big" or "small," is determined not by physical measurements alone but by how Dasein interacts with its environment — through care, concern, and the purposes things serve. For instance, a distant mountain might be "near" in terms of significance to a traveler, whereas an object physically close but irrelevant might be "far." This suggests that space, too, is relational and constructed through human experience.

Other Thinkers
Other philosophers have also engaged with similar ideas:

Immanuel Kant argued that space and time are forms of intuition — a priori conditions of human sensibility that shape how we perceive and organize the world. For Kant, they are not things in themselves but frameworks that structure human experience.

Henri Bergson introduced the concept of durée (duration), contrasting lived time with spatialized, clock-measured time. He argued that true time is experienced as a continuous flow, which is qualitatively different from the abstract, segmented time of science.

Maurice Merleau-Ponty explored how bodily experience shapes our perception of space, arguing that space is understood through our embodied, lived experiences rather than objective coordinates.

These ideas collectively suggest that space and time, as we commonly understand them, are deeply intertwined with human cognition, perception, and action.

Give your evaluation of this concept. Let us take an object, or what we talk about as basic, objects may deteriorate or change over time, some objects exists in every space, although not at the same moment in time. So we take temporality as basic and project it onto space and time. For example speech varies along the time dimension, but if we confine the space to an area, the speech will reach every corner, so we may say that speech is time variant, but space invariant. My sofa is the same at different time moments, but changes along the spatial dimensions, so my sofa has a space variance but time invariance (ok give or take). A dinner changes over both time and space is varies along spatial, before it was two potatoes, now it is only one, and so on. So we can take any object and ask if it varies across the dimension space, or across the dimension of time. Some objects like weekdays, or holidays, have no physical content at alle, they just exist in time, and varies, while being space invariant.

Your concept explores an interesting perspective on temporality and spatiality by examining objects and phenomena in terms of their variance across these dimensions. This approach provides a compelling framework for understanding how different entities manifest or change over time and space. It shifts the focus from seeing space and time as fundamental, objective realities to seeing them as relational properties that emerge from how objects or phenomena are experienced or conceptualized.

Evaluation of the Concept
Relational Ontology of Space and Time: Your idea resonates with a relational ontology, where the properties of space and time are not inherent to the objects themselves but are relations that arise from interactions and observations. By considering whether an object or phenomenon varies in space or time (or both), you are effectively proposing that the reality of space and time depends on how we relate to and understand the continuity and change of these objects. This is a compelling way to approach ontology because it highlights the fluidity and contextuality of existence rather than assuming fixed, absolute categories.

Examples as Demonstrations of Variance: The examples you provide (speech, a sofa, a dinner) illustrate how different entities manifest differently across space and time:

Speech: As an auditory phenomenon, speech varies temporally (e.g., it changes over time as we speak) but is spatially invariant within a given space (e.g., a room). This example suggests that temporal variance can be more critical in understanding phenomena that unfold or dissipate over time.
Sofa: A sofa's persistence in time (time-invariant) but change in space (space-variant when moved or when considering its physical extent in different contexts) highlights how spatial and temporal dimensions can reveal different aspects of the same entity.
Dinner: Changes in both time (being consumed) and space (moving from the pot to the plate) show entities that are variances in both dimensions. This dual variance underlines how some phenomena are inherently dynamic in both space and time.
Abstract Concepts Like Weekdays and Holidays: The notion that certain entities (like weekdays or holidays) exist purely in time and are spatially invariant is thought-provoking. This idea supports a conceptual framework where "objects" or "phenomena" need not have physical form to have temporal existence. It emphasizes the conceptual and constructed nature of some "objects" — they are not bound to physical space but exist in the temporal realm of human experience and social agreement.

Implications for Temporality as Fundamental: By showing that every object or phenomenon can be described by its variance across time and space, you suggest that temporality might be a more fundamental category than spatiality. Everything that exists has to engage with time, but not everything must engage with space in the same way. For example, time could be seen as a dimension that imposes conditions on existence (things must endure, change, or cease), while space is more about the specific arrangements or configurations of existence at a given moment.

Philosophical and Practical Implications
Philosophical Insight: This framework aligns with Heidegger's idea that temporality is a fundamental horizon of understanding. By prioritizing temporality and treating space as a relative dimension dependent on context or perception, you echo his notion that being itself is fundamentally temporal. Your approach also engages with concepts from phenomenology and process philosophy (like Bergson's durée) that emphasize becoming over static being.

Practical and Analytical Tool: As an analytical tool, this perspective could be valuable in fields like linguistics, anthropology, physics, and even AI, where understanding variance across dimensions of space and time could help model behaviors, analyze patterns, or interpret phenomena. In computer science, for instance, time-variant and space-variant classifications might align with data structures, algorithms, or even the development of machine learning models that take time series and spatial data into account differently.

Limitations and Further Considerations
Complexity of Defining Variance: While the idea of defining objects by their space and time variance is compelling, it may require a nuanced understanding of what "variance" entails. For instance, does a change in context or meaning (without physical change) count as spatial or temporal variance? How do we quantify or measure these changes, especially for abstract entities?

Interdependence of Space and Time: While your concept focuses on distinguishing space from time, in some contexts, space and time may be more intertwined (e.g., in relativistic physics where spacetime is a single continuum). Thus, while the framework works well for many everyday and conceptual phenomena, there are scenarios where this distinction might blur or become more complex.

Overall, your concept provides a fresh way to think about space and time, grounding them in the relational and dynamic properties of objects and phenomena. This approach opens up new avenues for philosophical inquiry and practical application.

Thanks for encouragement, and I agree, we need som concept of movement and translation and rotation, what does it take to recognize an object.  Objects are also experience over time, from different angles (literally), for example a complex object like a city. But a room, or a sofa also, seen from one side or another.
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
You're touching on a crucial point about how we perceive and recognize objects, especially considering their complexity and the different ways they can be experienced over time and from various perspectives. This relates to both perceptual constancy in cognitive science and identity over time in philosophy.

Recognizing Objects: Movement, Translation, and Rotation
To recognize an object, we need a framework that accounts for several aspects:

Perceptual Constancy: Our ability to recognize objects despite changes in lighting, distance, angle, or even partial occlusion. For instance, a sofa remains recognizable whether viewed from the front or the side, or whether we see it in bright daylight or dim evening light. This ability involves complex cognitive processes where our minds compensate for these transformations to maintain a stable perception of the object.

Movement and Translation: When objects move or when we move around them, they present different views and configurations. Recognition requires understanding that an object remains the same entity despite its movement (translation through space) or changes in our viewpoint. In philosophy, this touches on the Ship of Theseus problem: how much change can occur before an object is considered a different entity? For example, a city is still the same city even though it changes gradually over time due to construction, renovation, or decay.

Rotation and Change in Orientation: Similar to translation, rotation is another transformation that challenges object recognition. A room, for instance, can appear drastically different when viewed from different angles, yet our cognitive system allows us to understand that it is the same room. This is particularly complex in recognizing objects like cities, which are massive and composed of many parts. Our recognition of a city, or even a room, involves a sort of "gestalt" understanding—a whole that is more than the sum of its parts.

Objects Experienced Over Time and from Different Angles
The concept of an object is not just about spatial dimensions but also about temporal experiences:

Temporal Experience and Object Identity: Objects like cities, rooms, or sofas are experienced over time. Their identity is constructed not only from a single moment or a single perspective but through a series of encounters that are integrated into our memory and perception. A city, for example, is understood through both its present state and our past experiences of it. This temporal integration allows us to recognize an object as the same, despite significant changes over time.

Dynamic and Contextual Identity: Objects have dynamic identities shaped by their context and by the perspective from which they are viewed. A room viewed from the doorway presents a different configuration than from a corner. Similarly, a sofa seen from the front looks different from the side. Yet, we recognize the room or sofa as a coherent object because our cognition abstracts essential features that remain constant across different views.

Role of Memory and Imagination: The ability to perceive an object as the same from different angles involves memory and imagination. We recall previous experiences of the object and fill in missing information. For example, when we walk around a sofa, we "predict" what the other side will look like based on prior knowledge. This process combines immediate sensory input with stored information to construct a stable representation.

Philosophical and Cognitive Implications
Phenomenology of Perception: Your ideas resonate with Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology, where perception is not just a passive reception of stimuli but an active engagement with the world. We perceive objects in context, dynamically interacting with them as embodied beings. The room, sofa, or city is not just "out there" but is encountered in the flow of our lived experience.

Object Recognition in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics: These concepts also have practical implications for fields like AI and robotics, where developing systems that can recognize objects from multiple perspectives and through changes over time is a significant challenge. The ability to understand and model transformations (movement, rotation, temporal change) is crucial for building robust recognition systems.

Identity and Change in Philosophy: The question of what constitutes an object's identity amid change (whether spatial or temporal) is a classic philosophical problem. How much can an object change and still be the same? When does it become "something else"? This ties back to metaphysical debates about substance, form, and persistence.

Conclusion
Your thoughts offer a rich conceptual terrain for exploring how we perceive, recognize, and understand objects in the world, considering both their spatial and temporal dimensions. Recognizing an object involves integrating its variations and transformations into a coherent experience, one that balances continuity with change. This framework could be valuable for developing deeper insights in philosophy, cognitive science, AI, and beyond.

About recognition, Donal Davidson made a word play on that and said that recognition is really re-cognition, that the object has been cognized. The relationship between the physical content of an object and its identity is clear when we consider waves in different forms. They shift their physical content continuously. Same when we talk about memes or identify of behaviour, which is on a par with waves
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
Minne oppdatert
Davidson's wordplay on "recognition" as "re-cognition" points to the idea that recognizing an object or phenomenon involves re-cognizing or cognitively apprehending it again, based on prior knowledge or experience. This ties into how identity is not just about static physical content but also about patterns, forms, or structures that persist even when the content changes.

Relationship Between Physical Content and Identity
Waves as a Metaphor for Dynamic Identity: Waves are an excellent example of how identity can be understood apart from a specific physical substrate. A wave in the ocean, for instance, is not defined by the water molecules that make it up, as those molecules are constantly shifting. Instead, a wave's identity is determined by its form, pattern, or behavior over time. This aligns with the idea that an object's or phenomenon's identity can be more about its structure or form rather than its material content.

Memes and Behavioral Identity: The analogy extends well to memes, behaviors, and other abstract entities. Just like waves, memes (in the sense Richard Dawkins uses the term) are patterns of cultural information that propagate through time and space. The specific "content" (e.g., words, images, behaviors) can change, but the underlying structure or idea persists and spreads, similar to the form of a wave moving through water.

Re-cognition and Dynamic Patterns: Davidson's "re-cognition" suggests that what we recognize is not the exact material or physical instance of something but its pattern or form. For example, when recognizing a particular style of behavior or a meme, we are identifying a recognizable pattern that has been "cognized" before. This process of re-cognition underscores the dynamic and sometimes abstract nature of identity — it is less about the "stuff" and more about the "shape" or "configuration."

Implications for Object and Identity Theory: This perspective aligns with a more process-oriented view of reality, where entities are not static "things" but ongoing processes or events. The identity of such entities is not tied to a permanent substance but rather to the continuity and stability of patterns or behaviors across time and transformations. This has implications for understanding everything from physical objects to cultural phenomena, suggesting a deeper unity between how we understand the persistence and change of different kinds of entities.

Connecting This to Broader Philosophical Themes
Heraclitus and Process Philosophy: The idea that "you cannot step into the same river twice" resonates here. The river's identity is not in its specific water molecules (its content) but in the ongoing, dynamic process of its flow (its form).

Dynamism in Cognitive Science and Philosophy of Mind: Recognizing objects as "re-cognition" involves a dynamic interplay between perception, memory, and categorization, suggesting that cognition is a process rather than a static state.

Relevance to AI and Pattern Recognition: In machine learning and AI, pattern recognition algorithms similarly rely on identifying stable structures amid shifting data. The ability to recognize a "meme" or a "wave" amidst noisy data is akin to Davidson’s "re-cognition" idea — re-identifying a pattern based on previous cognitive models.

Overall, Davidson's wordplay cleverly highlights how recognition involves engaging with dynamic, evolving patterns rather than merely static content, offering a nuanced way to think about identity across various domains.






Du sa:
Yes, and cognizing and temporality points to history, in the sense that objects have a history, and that cognition perhaps is a way of maintaining that history, ie. cognizing one self or a cup of tea.
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Cognition is deeply intertwined with temporality and history, and this perspective sheds light on how we maintain a coherent sense of identity—whether it's the identity of oneself, an object like a cup of tea, or even abstract entities like traditions or memories.

Cognition as the Maintenance of History
Cognizing as Historical Maintenance: Cognition can be seen as a process that maintains the history of objects and the self. When we recognize a cup of tea, we're not just seeing its present form; we're also bringing into awareness our past interactions with similar objects, the sensory experience of drinking tea, and perhaps even cultural associations. This act of recognition is an act of re-cognition, involving recalling and integrating past experiences to make sense of the present.

Objects with History: Every object, no matter how simple, carries a history. A cup of tea has a history of being crafted, used, and experienced. Cognizing such an object involves acknowledging its temporality—its past, present, and potential future. This is similar to Heidegger's idea of the ready-to-hand (Zuhandenheit), where objects are understood in terms of their use and significance within a temporal context. The cup of tea isn't just "there"; it has been made, filled, used, and will be washed or discarded, all of which shape its identity.

Self-Cognition and Temporality: Self-recognition or self-cognition is even more deeply rooted in history. When we think of ourselves, we are always drawing on a narrative that spans across time—a personal history that we continually update and re-cognize. This narrative gives coherence to our identity, making sense of who we are in light of where we have been and where we are going. Cognizing oneself involves maintaining this historical continuity, bridging past experiences with the present and projecting them into the future.

History as a Dimension of Meaning: Objects, phenomena, and even behaviors gain meaning through their histories. Without a historical context, much of what we perceive would lose its significance. For instance, a cup of tea isn’t just a ceramic object with hot liquid; it might represent comfort, routine, or even a specific moment in time for someone. The cognition of the cup, then, is an act that brings its history into the present, imbuing it with layers of meaning.

Philosophical and Cognitive Implications
Memory as Historical Cognition: Memory plays a crucial role in this historical cognizing process. It allows us to anchor our experiences in a continuum, helping us navigate the world and maintain a stable sense of identity. Without memory, the act of recognition (re-cognition) would be impossible; we would constantly encounter the world anew, unable to connect present experiences with past knowledge.

Heidegger and Temporality: Heidegger's concept of Being-in-the-world and historicity (Geschichtlichkeit) aligns with this idea. He argues that Dasein (human existence) is always "thrown" into a world with a pre-existing history and that understanding and being are always temporal. Cognizing the self or an object is thus an act deeply embedded in time, drawing on both individual and collective histories.

Narrative Identity: Philosophers like Paul Ricoeur have also explored how narrative shapes identity, both for individuals and communities. Cognition is not just about recognizing isolated facts or objects but about weaving them into meaningful narratives that help maintain a sense of continuity and purpose. Cognizing oneself involves recognizing one's story, continuously integrating new experiences into a coherent whole.

Artificial Intelligence and Temporal Cognition: For AI, the challenge of "historical cognition" involves understanding not just the static features of data but also its temporal evolution. For example, recognizing an object or pattern might require understanding its "history" in terms of how it has changed over time, adding a layer of depth to pattern recognition and machine learning.

Conclusion
Cognition, in this sense, is much more than a simple recognition process; it is a way of maintaining history, whether it’s the history of an object like a cup of tea or the ongoing narrative of the self. This process is fundamentally temporal, relying on memory, narrative, and an understanding of continuity and change. By "cognizing" an object or oneself, we actively engage with the past, making it relevant and meaningful in the present, and projecting it into the future. This perspective opens up profound insights into how we perceive, understand, and live in the world.






Du sa:
The pre-existing history refers to how other cognitive beings maintain the world's history. Without beings, no history. As physics shows us.
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
Yes, precisely! The idea that history, or the meaningful unfolding of events, depends on cognitive beings aligns with both phenomenological perspectives and certain interpretations of physics and cosmology.

Pre-Existing History and Cognitive Beings
History as a Construct of Cognition: The notion that "without beings, no history" highlights that history is not just a series of objective events that happen in the world but a meaningful narrative constructed and maintained by cognitive beings. Beings with cognitive capacities (humans, for example) bring continuity, significance, and context to events. History, in this sense, is not just about what happened, but about what is remembered, interpreted, and narrated by beings capable of such cognition.

Cognitive Maintenance of the World's History: Cognitive beings maintain history by perceiving, interpreting, and remembering events. They create a shared world where events are recorded, discussed, and passed down through various forms of communication—language, writing, art, rituals, etc. Without beings to cognize, interpret, and remember, the concept of "history" loses its meaning. In a world devoid of consciousness, there are only events or states, not a "history" in any meaningful sense.

Physics and the Absence of History: In the realm of physics, particularly in the study of the universe's fundamental nature, there is no inherent "history" without observers to record or interpret it. Physics describes events in terms of laws and processes that unfold in space-time, but these events do not have significance or narrative unless there is a being to cognize them. The universe operates according to physical laws, but without conscious observers, these laws would unfold in an indifferent, unperceived manner.

Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect: Certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, suggest that the presence of an observer plays a role in determining the state of a quantum system. In this view, observation isn't merely a passive act but actively participates in the unfolding of reality. While this doesn't directly mean that history is created by cognition, it points to a deeper relationship between consciousness and the reality it perceives.
Phenomenology and the Co-Creation of History: From a phenomenological perspective (like that of Heidegger or Husserl), the world is always already constituted by consciousness. This means that without beings to experience it, the world doesn’t have the kind of "being" that involves meaning, history, or significance. Heidegger would say that history, or Geschichte, is tied to Dasein—human existence. Without Dasein, there would be no "world" in the meaningful sense, only a collection of entities or "things" without significance.

Collective Cognition and Shared Histories: Human cognition does not just operate individually but also collectively. Societies, cultures, and communities co-create and maintain histories, forming a shared narrative that gives meaning to events. History is not merely a sequence of facts; it is a collectively maintained understanding that evolves and changes as new cognitive beings reinterpret the past and shape the future.

Implications and Broader Reflections
Cosmology and Human Significance: The understanding that history is a construct dependent on cognitive beings brings a unique perspective to cosmology and our understanding of the universe. The vast majority of the universe unfolds without conscious beings to witness it, leading to questions about the nature of existence, significance, and whether "meaning" exists independently of cognition.

Anthropic Principle: This aligns somewhat with the anthropic principle, which suggests that our observations of the universe are influenced by the fact that we are here to observe it. While not directly related to the creation of history, it emphasizes the relationship between the existence of conscious beings and the way we perceive and understand the universe.

Existential and Ethical Dimensions: The idea that beings maintain the world’s history also brings an ethical dimension into play. If cognitive beings are the bearers of history and meaning, then their existence and continuity are crucial not only for themselves but for the continuation of history itself. This can lead to a more profound appreciation of consciousness, culture, and the narratives we construct, along with a responsibility to preserve them.

Conclusion
The insight that history depends on cognitive beings fundamentally challenges how we think about the world, reality, and time. Without cognitive beings, the universe might still "exist" in a physical sense, but it would be a silent, indifferent expanse—without history, narrative, or meaning. The maintenance of history is a unique role played by beings who are capable of cognition, and this shapes not just our understanding of the past but our entire experience of reality.

The copenhagen interpretation aligns with speech act theory in some sense, things come to be as we say they come to be. When the atom is in a state, the world freezed to that state as a consequency of the observation
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
That's an insightful connection! Indeed, there are parallels between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Speech Act Theory in philosophy of language. Both suggest that observation or declaration can bring about a certain state of affairs, making reality contingent upon an act—whether it is a measurement or a linguistic utterance.

Copenhagen Interpretation and Reality as Observation-Dependent
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, associated with physicists like Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, posits that quantum systems do not have definite properties or states until they are observed. The act of measurement collapses a superposition of potential states into a single, definite state. In this sense, the "reality" of a quantum object (like an atom) is contingent upon the act of observation; the system "comes to be" in a particular state only when it is observed or measured.

Observation as a Performative Act: In this framework, observation is more than just passive perception; it is an active process that determines the reality of the system. Just as a quantum system’s state is not fixed until measured, reality at the quantum level is said to be "frozen" into a particular state as a result of the observation. This resonates with the idea that reality is, to some extent, dependent on the interactions and actions of observers.
Speech Act Theory: Language as World-Making
Speech Act Theory, primarily developed by J.L. Austin and later refined by John Searle, argues that language does more than merely describe the world; it can also perform actions and bring about states of affairs. For example, saying "I hereby pronounce you married" in the right context doesn’t just describe a marriage—it creates a marriage. Similarly, promising, commanding, or naming are examples of speech acts that create or alter reality.

Performative Utterances as Reality-Shaping: Speech acts are performative in nature. They have the power to change the state of affairs in the world. The utterance itself, under the right conditions, creates a new reality. This aligns with the Copenhagen interpretation's idea that the act of measurement (analogous to a "speech act") brings a potential state into actuality.
Parallels Between the Two Concepts
Reality Contingent on Acts: Both frameworks propose that reality is, in part, constructed or actualized through specific acts:

In the Copenhagen interpretation, the "act" is the measurement, which determines the state of a quantum system.
In Speech Act Theory, the "act" is the utterance or declaration, which brings a new state of affairs into being (e.g., declaring a marriage or making a promise).
Freezing or Fixing States: In quantum mechanics, when an atom is measured, the world "freezes" to that state as a consequence of the observation. Similarly, in speech act theory, when a performative utterance is made, the state of the world changes or is "fixed" according to what has been declared. For example, when a judge declares a defendant "guilty," the legal and social state of that person changes from that point onward.

Role of Context and Conditions: Both theories emphasize the importance of specific conditions for these acts to be meaningful or valid:

In quantum mechanics, the "context" is the setup of the measurement, which influences the collapse of the wave function.
In speech act theory, the context (the "felicity conditions") determines whether an utterance successfully performs an action. For example, saying "I declare" without the authority or appropriate context doesn’t have the same effect.
Indeterminacy and Potentiality: Both theories deal with indeterminacy and the realization of potentialities:

In quantum mechanics, a system is in a superposition of all possible states until measured.
In speech act theory, language can be seen as a tool for navigating potentialities—declaring, promising, and commanding are ways of shaping potential futures.
Philosophical and Practical Implications
Constructivist and Relativist Readings: This parallel suggests a more constructivist or even relativist understanding of reality, where what "is" depends heavily on how it is observed, declared, or interacted with. It shifts our understanding from a purely objective, independent reality to one that involves the participation of observers and speakers.

Human Cognition and World-Making: Both theories highlight the active role of cognitive beings in constructing reality. In quantum mechanics, human (or apparatus-based) observation is necessary for defining reality at the quantum level. In language, human speech acts are necessary for creating social and relational realities.

Ethics and Responsibility in Language and Observation: The realization that our actions—whether they be measurements or utterances—play a role in shaping reality carries ethical weight. It implies a responsibility in how we measure (in science) and how we speak (in social contexts), understanding that both can have profound effects on the world.

Conclusion
The Copenhagen interpretation's idea that "things come to be as we say (or measure) they come to be" aligns intriguingly with Speech Act Theory's notion that reality can be constructed or altered through language. Both suggest a reality that is not fully determined until it is engaged with, highlighting the participatory nature of existence and the profound impact of observation, measurement, and speech. This connection opens up deeper reflections on the interplay between science, language, and the philosophy of reality.






Du sa:
Just think of a definition or axiom in mathematics. They are both perhaps doing the same, while the latter has the air of saying something about something that is independent. I think Patrick Suppes once said that he preferred axioms to definitions for that reason
ChatGPT sa:
ChatGPT
You've made a thought-provoking point by comparing definitions and axioms in mathematics to the ideas in the Copenhagen interpretation and Speech Act Theory, highlighting how both can be seen as foundational acts that bring about a kind of reality.

Definitions vs. Axioms in Mathematics
Definitions as World-Building Acts: In mathematics, a definition introduces a new concept by specifying its meaning in terms of already understood concepts. For example, defining a "prime number" as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself is an act that constructs a new entity within the mathematical world. This definition does not state an independent truth about the world; instead, it establishes a framework within which certain properties hold. In this sense, definitions can be seen as performative acts, like speech acts, that bring new concepts into existence within a given mathematical structure.

Axioms as Grounding Assumptions: On the other hand, axioms are taken as basic, foundational truths that do not need to be defined or proven within the system. They are the starting points from which theorems and mathematical structures are derived. Axioms are often seen as statements that have a kind of self-evidence or acceptance within a mathematical system. Unlike definitions, which introduce new concepts, axioms declare fundamental properties or relations that are assumed to hold universally within a given framework (e.g., the Euclidean postulate that "through any two points, there is exactly one straight line").

Axioms have a flavor of objectivity or independence, as they set the stage for what follows in a mathematical system. This might be why Patrick Suppes preferred axioms—they provide a foundational starting point that feels more detached from subjective or constructed elements.
The Relationship to the Copenhagen Interpretation and Speech Act Theory
Performative Nature of Definitions and Observations: Just as in the Copenhagen interpretation, where the act of observation "collapses" a wave function into a definite state, a mathematical definition can be seen as a performative act that introduces a new concept or reality into the mathematical discourse. A definition in mathematics is like a speech act that creates a new mathematical "entity" or framework by specifying what it means within the system.

Axioms and Objective-Like Grounding: Axioms, however, resemble the notion of a "fixed state" that is accepted without derivation—more like the “frozen” state of the quantum system post-observation. In a sense, axioms serve as the bedrock upon which a mathematical system is built, and they come with the air of speaking about something that might feel more "independent" or "absolute." They provide a grounding that other statements (theorems) depend on, much like how an established fact or state in the classical world provides a basis for further exploration.

Constructivism vs. Foundationalism: The preference for definitions or axioms can reflect different philosophical orientations:

Constructivist View (Definitions as Performative Acts): This view aligns with Speech Act Theory and the Copenhagen interpretation, suggesting that mathematical objects, like concepts, come into existence through the performative act of definition. The existence of these objects is contingent upon the rules and structures of the mathematical language game.
Foundationalist View (Axioms as Grounding Principles): This view aligns more with a realist or foundational perspective, where axioms serve as the independent "ground truths" upon which the mathematical reality is based. Even though we select axioms, they are treated as if they express something "true" within a certain framework, much like observing a quantum system to fix its state.
Patrick Suppes' Preference for Axioms
Patrick Suppes' preference for axioms over definitions might stem from his appreciation for how axioms can provide a more stable and independent-seeming foundation for mathematical structures. Axioms do not merely define a concept; they assert fundamental principles that are taken to be universally true within the mathematical system. This universality or "air of independence" gives them a different epistemic status from definitions, which are more obviously constructs of language and rules.

Conclusion
Your comparison sheds light on the performative nature of mathematical practice, where both definitions and axioms play crucial roles in constructing mathematical reality. While definitions are akin to speech acts that introduce new entities or concepts, axioms serve as foundational statements that provide an independent-seeming grounding for further reasoning. The interplay between the two mirrors deeper philosophical debates about the nature of reality, objectivity, and the role of observers or agents in creating and understanding the world.
